# ToggleIconView

ToggleIconView lets you create two-stage and animated-toggle icons.

It uses `AnimatedVectorDrawableCompat` under the hood and extends `AppCompatImageView`. So you can use it in the same way as `AppCompatImageView`.

## TODO

There is lot more to do.

- [ ] Improve the docs (with screenshots, code examples, etc.)
- [ ] Add new built-in icon (Start with https://github.com/ozgurg/ShapeShifter-Collection)
- [ ] Write how to create their own icon
- [ ] Make it more configurable (with XML)
- [ ] Make it extensible (with docs)
- [ ] Make it more robust (with tests)
- [ ] There is a lot of boilerplate code requires to make it extensible (3 constructor ðŸ˜¡). It
  should be easier to use
